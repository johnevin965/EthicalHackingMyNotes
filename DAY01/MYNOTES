Day 01 – Introduction to Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking

Date: 21st July 2025
Instructor: Captain Vaishnavu C V (aka Vyshu)
Track: Cybersecurity | Ethical Hacking

🔐 What is Cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity is all about protecting systems, networks, and data from attacks. These attacks could try to:

Steal or change sensitive info

Cause damage or shutdowns

Ask for ransom (like ransomware attacks)

A quote that really stuck with me:
“Cybersecurity is not just a tech issue – it’s also about people and business.”

🛡️ Three Main Domains in Cybersecurity:

🔵 Blue Team (Defense)

Their job is to protect systems and respond to attacks.

Tools: SIEM, IDS/IPS, EDR, Firewalls

Tasks: Monitoring logs, patching systems, threat hunting

🔴 Red Team (Attack/Ethical Hacking)

They simulate real-world attacks to find weaknesses.

Tools: Kali Linux, Metasploit, Nmap, Burp Suite

Tasks: Pen testing, exploiting, social engineering

🟣 Purple Team (Collaboration)

These folks connect Red + Blue teams.

They make both teams stronger by sharing tactics and doing joint exercises.

✅ What I Learned Today (as an L1 Beginner):

What cybersecurity is and why it matters

The 3 major teams (Red, Blue, Purple) and what each does

Some common tools used in ethical hacking and defense

That ethical hacking is not just about hacking — it’s about doing it responsibly

🧠 Beginner Mindset Notes:

Always think: “How would I break this system?” and “How would I protect it?”

Time to get more comfortable with terminals and networking basics

Stay curious and don’t be afraid to experiment (in a safe lab!)

📌 To-Do / Next Steps:

Set up my lab (VirtualBox + Kali Linux ✅)

Look up some big cyberattacks (WannaCry, Equifax, etc.) and how they were handled

Study basic cybersecurity terms like:

CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)

Threat, Vulnerability, Exploit

🚀 Final Thought:

This is just Day 1. It's going to take time, but I’m excited.
Cybersecurity is a journey — not a quick course. Stay consistent!
